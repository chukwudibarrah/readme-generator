# README Generator

## Description

It is important to have a high-quality README when creating an open source project on GitHub. This should include what the project is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project. 

This README generator allows you to quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows you to devote more time to working on the project.

## Task

The task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

The application can be invoked by using the `node index.js` command.
